# forgetask

Project to learn how to use Rust and Tauri because I have no idea how this works.
Foretask = forget + task
App for task management, name chosen because forgetting things all day at a young age is the new meta.

Features will be added later.

## To do

- Make a list of things to add.
- Choose a way to save the data.
- Create the icons.
- Regret my life choices.
- Hope this project doesn't kill me.
- Learn how Rust and Tauri work (optional), hate Javascript (mandatory).
