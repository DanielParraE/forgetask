# forgetask

Project to learn how to use Rust and Tauri because I have no idea how this works.

forgetask = forget + task

App for task management, name chosen because forgetting things all day at a young age is the new meta.

## Features

- Create, modify, and access notes.
- Create, modify, and access groups (folders).
- Save and close notes.
- Navigation with buttons. (hardly a feature XD)
- Well, yeah.

## TO DO

- Access notes from folders apart. (NEW)
- Delete funtion. (NEW)
- Change the name display of item so it doesn't overlap when it's too long. (NEW)
- Desktop notifications. (NEW)
- Mark note or group as important. (NEW)
- ~~Make a list of things to add.~~
- ~~Choose a way to save the data.~~
- ~~Create the icons.~~ (kinda, I still need more)
- ~~Regret my life choices.~~
- ~~Hope this project doesn't kill me.~~
- Learn how Rust and Tauri work (optional)
- ~~Hate Javascript (mandatory).~~

## Thoughts

I was expecting this project to help me improve my backend skills, but I spent more time solving frontend problems than dealing with Rust.
At least I now understand the concept of CSS, but it doesn't stop me from still hating it.
Tauri is by far a better choice than ElectronJS, it's super comfy to use and I feel that my code it's more readable.
